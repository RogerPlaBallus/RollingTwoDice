![diceImg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf7c412-8743-4de8-a7cb-536aa1b9774a)

1. Two dices start at position 1.
2. Press the Roll button and an animation will change the dice images to simulate movement.
3. It will roll for 3 seconds and then end with a random dice image from 1 to 6.
4. Press the Roll button until you are satisfied.
